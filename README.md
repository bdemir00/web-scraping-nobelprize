I thought it would be fun to extract data from Wikipedia about Nobel laureates and analyse their zodiac signs.

*Used technology: python, pandas, beautiful soup*

## Python file
The process of scraping the data was performed using pandas and Beautiful Soup library [main.py](https://github.com/bdemir00/web-scraping/blob/main/main.py)

## Output
The created dataset is saved as .csv file [nobel.csv](https://github.com/bdemir00/web-scraping/blob/main/nobel.csv).
Please note that the dataset is not fully complete due to inconsistency of HTML structure in Wikipedia pages.

## Visualisation
Data visualisation was performed via Microsoft PowerBI. A .pbix file is and screenshots are included.
